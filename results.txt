This is a summary of the convolution program on the bike.ppm image for local work group size 16 x 16.

			MacBook Air	CIMS opencl1	CIMS cuda1
Processed MPixels/s	141.141237	238.384257	2530.117542
Bandwidth (Gbit/s)	1.129130	1.907074	20.240940
GFlop/s			6.832123	11.539297	122.473594

The same table for 8 x 8.

			MacBook Air	CIMS opencl1	CIMS cuda1
Processed MPixels/s	137.071843	181.505986	1607.523275
Bandwidth (Gbit/s)	1.096575	1.452048	12.860186
GFlop/s			6.635139	8.786031	77.814232

As can be seen, decreasing the work group size results in reductions for all quantities, with the most noticeable being on cuda1,
then on opencl1, and then on the MacBook Air.

Following this, we will discuss the results of iteratively applying the convolution to already blurred images, with the updates to the images written back to the imageIn file for convolution.cl.

As can be seen from each of the output_cl_*.ppm pictures, with * refering to the number of iterations applied, the higher the number of iterations, the more the image becomes blurred until nothing is recognizeable anymore.
